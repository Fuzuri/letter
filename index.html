        <h1>Hi, my love</h1>
        <p>This is the well-structured letter with good grammar (CRY EMOJI), and if you want the unpolished version, just request it! Anyways, I hope this letter finds you well as we approach Valentine's Day. I wanted to take this opportunity to express my thoughts and feelings about you. From the moment we met, it felt like a connection unlike any other I've experienced before. It's as if you speak the language of my soul effortlessly. You understand me in a way that no one else does, and for that, I am grateful.</p>
        <p>Despite the short time we've known each other, there's something about you that draws me in. I've encountered many people in my life, some of whom have shown interest in me and vice versa. Yet, none of them compare to you. You feel like home to me, a place where I can truly be myself without any pretense. It may seem strange to feel this way so soon, but I can't help but acknowledge the undeniable connection between us.</p>
        <p>I must admit that I have a tendency to be emotionally unavailable, someone who struggles to understand and express their feelings. But with you, it's different. You have a way of breaking down my walls effortlessly. It's almost as if you've cast a spell on me, making me want to open up and explore this newfound connection with you. I'm eager to learn more about you, Chi. I want to hear about your dreams, your struggles, and everything in between. I want to be someone you can confide in, someone who makes you feel comfortable being your true self. I want to unravel the stories of your life that have shaped you into the person you are today.</p>
        <p>Chi, talking to you is like gazing at a sky full of stars, each one shining brightly. Yet, amidst them all, there's one star that captures my attentionâ€”the one that represents you. I hope to have the honor of being your Valentine this February 14th.</p>
        <p>I understand that distance and other circumstances may prevent us from meeting in person, but I hope you'll accept this letter and the handmade flowers I've crafted for you as a token of my affection.</p>
        <p>With warm regards,</p>
        <p>Jimz Calo</p>
        <p>(P.S. I couldn't help but smile when I received your good morning message today; little did you know I was in the midst of writing this letter to you!)</p>
